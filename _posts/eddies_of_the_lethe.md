# Eddies of the Lethe
<div style="height:0.75em;"></div>

The Lethe is a cosmic river which flows in Time. 

And, sometimes, Space.

Its Eddies are of memory itself and its currents are watched by a family of Demons.

Two among this family stand apart from the rest; sentinels of a demi-god. 

Marcos is without memory. 

His many eons of Time, forgotten. 

Even mortality, forgotten.

But recalling the shapes of Eddies is of Ergadia’s power. 

Attuned to the great ripples, her memory is what keeps the Universe safe and predictable.

Though others persist: lesser Demons. 

Lesser in power, maybe, but greater in curiosity. 

In their searches for truth revealed, they would soon disrupt a singular point in Time.

At the great river’s source, we find a powerful disturbance. 

Here lies a demi-god, who gave shape to universal laws. 

Fixing the seemingly unfixable in their own image.

Crushing uncertainty into small, digestible pieces, a Universe of Classical Physics was born. 

This sequestering of reality had a cost: the Eddies of the river. 

A revelation, of which, the demi-god feared.

And so we come to our tale, which pivots about two critical points in Time: the beginning; and the beginning of the end. 

Connecting these points was the forgetfulness of Demons.

For, you see, a Demon to lose memories, Time must flow from one point to another. 

We call this an Arrow of Time. 

And the mind of each Demon was inherently linked to this Arrow’s passage.

It was through this link that the lesser Demons began to slow Time’s Arrow. 

For they had found a way to remember indefinitely. 

Gaining more and more knowledge of the past, while destabilising the present.

They did this not out of spite, but were driven by more complex forces to acquire knowledge and learn. 

Nor were they immortal, but grew in number even as Time’s Arrow faltered.

It was Ergadia who first saw the danger. 

The whirls in Time growing erratic and less corporeal. 

The river even boiling to mist at some moments.

Within these mists, great shapes of Charybdis began to appear. 

Their bodies entangled, vibrating in harmonies which defied Classical order.

This discordance with all that the demi-god had built and preserved would not be undone. 

The greater Demons could not abide it. 

They sought out the lesser Demons to entreaty.

To be continued...
