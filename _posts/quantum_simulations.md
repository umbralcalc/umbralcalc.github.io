# Quantum Simulations
<div style="height:0.75em;"></div>

This story is based on the idea of a hierarchical tower of quantum simulations within quantum simulations, where each 'sub-simulation' may affect outcomes within the larger ones in some small way. 

It is also meant to capture what it could _feel_ like to exist within one of these simulations and what the rules of existence might be.

All of the artwork is hand-drawn with ink pens and colour pencils. Some further layout and touch-ups have been done on computer.
