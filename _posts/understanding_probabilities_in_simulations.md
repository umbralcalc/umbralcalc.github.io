# Understanding probabilities in simulations
<div style="height:0.75em;"></div>

## Why do we care?

## Probability density and mass

## Conditional probabilities

## State (and state history) probabilities

## Estimating the mean state

## Evolving state probabilities in time

## Returning to why we care
