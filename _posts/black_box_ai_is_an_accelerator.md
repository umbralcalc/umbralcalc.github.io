# Black box AI is an accelerator
<div style="height:0.75em;"></div>

## Some opinions

Here are some opinions on the realistic potential for 'black box' AI methods to improve human prediction and decision-making processes.

A 'black box' AI method for prediction here means a tool we can use to predict outcomes (provided sufficient relevant data), but which cannot be easily interrogated for insights into _why_ a specific prediction was made.

## Data is often irrelevant, incomplete, scarce or wrong

For many high-value problems that humanity (or just businesses) would like solve, the truth is that data is often irrelevant, incomplete, scarce or wrong.

## Keeping humans in the loop with world models

- Inductive bias brings more information, for better or worse
- AI should be providing _insights_, not just predictive outputs

There is a _lot_ of nuance on what level of predictive 'explainability' is actually needed to achieve a goal with these tools.

## Black box AI is an accelerator

- Black box AI therefore can't have all the answers, but can be an enormous accelerator in this paradigm
- We can see this already with Agentic tools for writing simulation code and bespoke simulation emulators
