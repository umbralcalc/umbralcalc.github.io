# Technically Unnatural
<div style="height:0.75em;"></div>

They say there are things that are technically natural and there are things which, _they say_, are not. Differentiating between these two can be tricky, at best. And, definitely at worst; we give the task to Physicists.

This is what I do. More specifically? I stare at a screen, wait for the next anomaly, identify said anomaly for The Lab and then… well… back to staring.

I need caffeine.

Even the cat’s bored. I should probably feed the little guy. It’s not as if today is likely to be a ‘discovery’ day; and those have been getting fewer and fewer each month.

Since turning on this 'scientific discovery intelligence' machine, my initial excitement fell to disillusionment pretty quickly. Fighting back; my mind seems to have settled on a few granules of hope a month. _Granules_? Oh, coffee. Right!

That same mind of mine recalls laminar flows, directed percolations and all the rest of humanity’s best efforts to understand how to make a better cup of coffee. Now we just let the AI do it and… yeah, it tastes pretty damn good.
