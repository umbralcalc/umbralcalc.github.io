# Technically Unnatural
<div style="height:0.75em;"></div>

This story is inspired directly by the ideas of '[fine-tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(physics))' and 'technical naturalness' in physics. 

The story anthropomorphizes these technical concepts into everyday human judgements made by a lazy bureaucrat.

All of the artwork is hand-drawn with ink pens and colour pencils. Some further layout and touch-ups have been done on computer.
