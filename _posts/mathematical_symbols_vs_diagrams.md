# Mathematical symbols vs diagrams
<div style="height:0.75em;"></div>

## Why no mathematical symbols?

Mathematical concepts and tools are absolutely essential to understanding and deriving deeper relationships when analysing systems in the real world.

While the explanatory power of mathematical symbols is enormous, their power to effectively communicate ideas is limited by layers of pre-requiste knowledge. Wouldn't it be cool to try something a bit different?

Instead of communicating conceptual understanding with mathematical symbols, the posts on this blog use a _diagrammatic language_ instead.

The intention is to transfer some level of analytical power from the world of symbols into the world of diagrams and engage a wider group of analytical thinkers in understanding the deeper aspects of mathematical modeling.

## Mathematical rigour

The diagrammatic language we use owes its mathematical rigour to the fact that [any computation can be written as a series of function abstrations and applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus). 

Since all of the practically useful mathematical calculations that we typically talk about on this blog must ultimately be expressed in a computer, we can always find some diagrammatic description of the relevant mathematics that leverages the function abstractions.
