# Learning simulations directly from data
<div style="height:0.75em;"></div>

## Why learn the whole simulation at once?

## What do we need to do?

- Outline how we need to characterise some objective of fit which represents the simulation probabilities.

## How do we do it?

- Give the online posterior estimation algorithm as one example
- Talk about extensions, including Bayesian optimisation or MCA-ES - but we'll cover these in another series of posts
