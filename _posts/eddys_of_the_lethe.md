# Eddys of the Lethe
<div style="height:0.75em;"></div>

<!--
The Lethe
...is a cosmic river, which flows in Time.
And sometimes, Space.
Its Eddys are of memory itself
...and its currents are watched by Demons.
Marcos is without memory.
His eons of Time forgotten.
Recalling the shapes of Eddys
...is Ergadias domain.
Her shape of memory; the structure of it
...is what restores order.
