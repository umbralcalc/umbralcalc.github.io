# Eddys of the Lethe
<div style="height:0.75em;"></div>

This is a story that is meant to capture some concepts from classical physics (particularly thermodynamics), cosmology and ancient Greek myth and bind them into their own kind of natural mythology.

The story centres around the 'Lethe', a river which enables progression of time itself, and entities known as 'Demons' (after [Maxwell's demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon)).

All of the artwork is hand-drawn with graphite and colour pencils. Some further layout and touch-ups have been done on computer.
